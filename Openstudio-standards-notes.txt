Notes:

- Unify the naming conventions (building_vintage, standard, template etc)
- The MidriseApartment is set to be is_residential="No" (standards_construction_sets.json as well as OpenStudio_standards_space_types.json). should be yes for at least Corridor and Apartment IMHO. 

- The building_type is an argument but it is actually not used aside from naming the building.

- Standards.Model.performance_rating_method_baseline_system_groups => Add a check to exclude not part of total area or unconditioned zones, such as plenums (potentially hoistways too, not sure here)
    * In Standards.ThermalZone.is_residential before calling Standards.Space.is_residential
        # Ignore space if not part of total area
        next if !space.partofTotalFloorArea
    * Might be a good idea to add a standards "Plenum" space type to OpenStudio...
    
    * Also need to take the zone multiplier into account for the square footage => I added "ThermalZone.get_net_area"
    
    * Doubt this when/else statement should have the same outcome
