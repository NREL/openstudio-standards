Example of groups generation.

group size = 8, iteration size = 4

space type group (iteration 1) = (st0, st1, st2, st3, st4, st5, st6, st7)
space_type group (iteration 2) = (st8, st9, st10, st11, st4, st5, st6, st7)
space_type group (iteration 3) = (st8, st9, st10, st11, st12, st13, st14, st15)

max sch_st in one group = 2
max sch_st of same st = 1

algorithm :
do
pop random st (all st have same chance)
    if st is sch:
        verify that current group doesnt have more than 2 sch_st
        pop random sch
        add random sch to group
    else
        add random st to group
    if group has 5 st, move on to another group
repeat until there are still sts to pop


given that there are 190 st, every group will be filled
if some space-types were to be removed or added, algorithm has to be modified to fill all groups

Example of sorting for groups of similar sts

space type pool:

space_type group (iteration1) = (st0-a, st0-b, st1-a, st1-b, st4, st5, st6, st7)
