    # Building STRUCTURE parameters, ultimately driving BTAP definitions of e.g.
    #   - internal mass
    #   - envelope CLADDING/FRAMING/FINISH selection
    #   - related thermal bridging calculations (and uprated insulation levels)
    #   - costing
    #   - embodied carbon tallies
    #
    # As detailed a bit further on, this determination is either via user input:
    #   - e.g. "clt" (mass timber) post/beam STRUCTURE, for a school.
    #
    # Or auto-assigned based on the prevalence of model space type assignments:
    #   - e.g. 75% of spaces are commercial in nature (see activity.rb),
    #     therefore the building STRUCTURE defaults to "steel" post/beam.
    #
    # The overarching idea is that (in most cases) OpenStudio surface
    # construction & material choices (in addition to internal mass definitions),
    # mostly stem from underlying structural design choices (which aren't
    # natively defined in OpenStudio). Structural choices have more to do with
    # fire safety, budget, durability & practicality (low-rise vs high-rise),
    # local workforce, on-site vs prefab, etc.
    #
    # Ensuring consistency between building STRUCTURE, envelope selection,
    # internal mass definitions, etc. is key in harmonizing predicted energy
    # use, peak demand assessments, GHG emissions, vs thermal resilience and
    # embodied energy/GHG tallies.

    # Although "wood" framed walls constitute the load-bearing components of a
    # "wood" framed building STRUCTURE (ex. low-rise housing), they can equally
    # be found as non-load-bearing components in a "clt" post-beam STRUCTURE.
    # Light gauge "steel" framed walls are much more common in a non-residential
    # STRUCTURE (e.g. "steel" post/frame, "concrete" post & beam, and even
    # "clt"), though rarely found in low-rise housing. Although one may observe
    # some real-world mixing of STRUCTURE vs FRAMING in a building, it remains
    # largely deterministic: designers select constructions (FRAMING,
    # insulation) while taking building classification and STRUCTURE selection
    # into consideration - the inverse is rarely true.

    #   __________  ___________________________________________________________
    #   "steel"     steel, post/frame (default)
    #   "metal"     prefab panelized steel STRUCTURE (**, ++), typically 1 story
    #   "concrete"  reinforced concrete, post/beam/slab
    #   "cmu"       load-bearing concrete masonry unit walls, typically 1-story

    #   NOTES:
    #
    #    **  Neither "metal" nor "clt" options can be considered as fully
    #        supported by BTAP, e.g.:
    #          - no range of admissible envelope Uo factors
    #          - no associated PSI-factors (thermal bridging)
    #          - no costing data
    #          - no embodied energy/carbon data
    #        They are nonetheless (minimally) maintained here as an
    #        "aide-mÃ©moire" for future BTAP upgrades - @todo.

    #
    #        "METAL BUILDING": a complete integrated set of mutually dependent
    #        components and assemblies that form a building, which consists of
    #        a steel-framed superSTRUCTURE and metal skin.
    #
    #        "METAL BUILDING ROOF": a roof that:
    #        a. is constructed with a metal, structural, weathering surface;
    #        b. has no ventilated cavity; and
    #        c. has the insulation entirely below deck (i.e., does not include
    #           composite concrete and metal deck construction nor a roof
    #           FRAMING system that is separated from the superSTRUCTURE by a
    #           wood substrate) and whose STRUCTURE consists of one or more of
    #           the following configurations:
    #           1. Metal roofing in direct contact with steel FRAMING members
    #           2. Metal roofing separated from steel FRAMING by insulation
    #           3. Insulated metal roofing panels installed per (a) or (b)
    #
    #        "METAL BUILDING WALL": a wall whose STRUCTURE consists of metal
    #        spanning members supported by steel structural members (i.e. does
    #        not include spandrel glass or metal panels in curtain wall systems).
    #
    # Note that there's a (growing?) need to contrast "metal" buildings against
    # the default "steel" post/beam option. Like a "wood" framed STRUCTURE or a
    # load-bearing "cmu" wall, a "metal" building's envelope structure and skin
    # are indistinguishable, i.e. no mixing/matching of STRUCTURE vs envelope.
    #
    # There are of course several other (smaller scale) structural options,
    # often load-bearing envelopes like adobe/hemp/straw bale construction. Most
    # would agree that these are fairly rare occurrences - rare enough to avoid
    # shortlisting them for commercial building stock assessments. One could
    # state the same when it comes to the current (marginal) use of "clt". Yet
    # as the latter is rapidly becoming a robust low-carbon alternative to
    # "steel" and "concrete" options, its inclusion is justified. Additional
    # options may nonetheless be added in the future.

      # The 'liveload' attribute represents the mass area density (kg/m2) of
      # dynamic, yet uniform floor live load from non-permament items like
      # furniture, documents, copiers and computers, i.e. not real estate
      # assets. Architects and engineers deal with (fixed) live load as design
      # constraint - not as potential design option. Non-occupant live load is
      # taken into account when setting internal mass. Yet as a non-real estate
      # item, live load is not considered when tallying embodied carbon.
      #
      # Within BTAP, non-occupant live load estimates are stored in the
      # "NECB_building_types.csv" file, parsed/stored in a BTAP::Activity
      # instance (1x per building activity). These estimates are initially based
      # on NBC Part 4 minimum live load requirements (kPa), as well as data from
      # established structural engineering resources. Minimum live load kPa (or
      # psf) estimates, corresponding to hundreds of kg/m2 of floor area, are
      # strictly for structural dimensioning/safety purposes. They are not (or
      # are very rarely) representative of actual day-to-day loads. Back of the
      # envelope calculations suggest reducing live load code requirements down
      # to 1/8th of their initial values for internal mass purposes. These
      # code requirements also include occupants, which should be set aside -
      # by substracting the total building population mass:
      #
      #   - NECB building occupant density (occupant/m2) x avg. 80 kg/adult
      #
      # This gives for instance a resulting live load estimate of 20 kg/m2 for
      # housing (low) and a 90 kg/m2 for manufacturing (high). It is obviously
      # challenging to pin down a single-number estimate for several building
      # types, including bigbox retail and warehousing. Grain of salt.
