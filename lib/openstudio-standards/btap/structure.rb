  # Building STRUCTURE parameters, ultimately driving BTAP definitions of e.g.:
  #   - internal mass
  #   - envelope CLADDING/FRAMING/FINISH selection
  #   - related thermal bridging calculations (and uprated insulation levels)
  #   - costing
  #   - embodied carbon tallies
  #
  # As detailed a bit further on, this determination is either via user input:
  #   - e.g. "clt" (mass timber) post/beam STRUCTURE, for a school.
  #
  # Or auto-assigned based on the prevalence of model space type assignments:
  #   - e.g. 75% of spaces are commercial in nature, therefore the building
  #          STRUCTURE defaults to "steel" post/beam
  #
  # The overarching idea is that (in most cases) OpenStudio surface construction
  # & material choices (in addition to internal mass definitions), mostly stem
  # from underlying structural design choices (which aren't natively defined in
  # OpenStudio). Structural choices have more to do with fire safety, budget,
  # practicality (low-rise vs high-rise), local workforce, durability, etc.
  # Ensuring consistency between building STRUCTURE, envelope selection,
  # internal mass definitions, etc. is key in harmonizing predicted energy use,
  # peak demand assessments, GHG emissions, vs thermal resilience and embodied
  # energy/GHG tallies.
  #
  # Although "wood" framed walls constitute the load-bearing components of a
  # "wood" framed building STRUCTURE (ex. low-rise housing), they can equally be
  # found as non-load-bearing components in a "clt" post-beam STRUCTURE. Light
  # gauge "steel" framed walls are much more common in a non-residential
  # STRUCTURE (e.g. "steel" post/frame, "concrete" post & beam, and even "clt"),
  # though rarely found in low-rise housing. Although one may observe some real
  # -world mixing of STRUCTURE vs FRAMING in a building, it remains largely
  # deterministic: designers select constructions (FRAMING, insulation) while
  # taking building classification and STRUCTURE selection into consideration
  # - the inverse is rarely true.

  #   STRUCTURE   description
  #   __________  ___________________________________________________________
  #   "steel"     steel, post/frame (default)
  #   "metal"     pre-fab panelized steel STRUCTURE (**, ++), typically 1 story
  #   "concrete"  reinforced concrete, post/beam/slab
  #   "cmu"       load-bearing concrete masonry unit walls, typically 1-story

  #
  #   NOTES:
  #
  #    **  Neither "metal" nor "clt" options can be considered as fully
  #        supported by BTAP, e.g.:
  #          - no range of admissible envelope Uo factors
  #          - no associated PSI-factors (thermal bridging)
  #          - no costing data
  #          - no embodied energy/carbon data
  #        They are nonetheless (minimally) maintained here as an "aide-mÃ©moire"

  #    ++  ASHRAE 90.1 2022 definitions of:
  #
  #        "METAL BUILDING": a complete integrated set of mutually dependent
  #        components and assemblies that form a building, which consists of a
  #        steel-framed superSTRUCTURE and metal skin.
  #
  #        "METAL BUILDING ROOF": a roof that:
  #        a. is constructed with a metal, structural, weathering surface;
  #        b. has no ventilated cavity; and
  #        c. has the insulation entirely below deck (i.e., does not include
  #           composite concrete and metal deck construction nor a roof
  #           FRAMING system that is separated from the superSTRUCTURE by a
  #           wood substrate) and whose STRUCTURE consists of one or more of the
  #           following configurations:
  #           1. Metal roofing in direct contact with the steel FRAMING members
  #           2. Metal roofing separated from steel FRAMING by insulation
  #           3. Insulated metal roofing panels installed per (a) or (b)
  #
  #        "METAL BUILDING WALL": a wall whose STRUCTURE consists of metal
  #        spanning members supported by steel structural members (i.e. does not
  #        include spandrel glass or metal panels in curtain wall systems).
  #
  # Note that there's a (growing?) need to contrast "metal" buildings against
  # the default "steel" post/beam option. Like a "wood" framed STRUCTURE or a
  # load-bearing "cmu" wall, a "metal" building's envelope structure and skin
  # are indistinguishable, i.e. no mixing/matching of STRUCTURE vs envelope.
  #
  # There are of course several other (smaller scale) structural options,
  # often load-bearing envelopes like adobe/hemp/straw bale construction. Most
  # would agree that these are fairly rare occurrences - rare enough to avoid
  # shortlisting them for commercial building stock assessments. One could
  # state the same when it comes to the current (marginal) use of "clt". Yet as
  # the latter is rapidly becoming a robust low-carbon alternative to "steel"
  # and "concrete" options, its inclusion is justified. Additional options may
  # nonetheless be added in the future.

  module StructureData
    # Each STRUCTURE inherits a default FRAMING option. Together with the
    # STRUCTURE selection, FRAMING determines inter alia:
