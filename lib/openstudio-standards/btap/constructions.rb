# This module deals with constructions used by BTAP for costing and carbon
# analysis. These constructions are separate from the ones used in the actual

    # BTAP/TBD data initially extracted from the BTAP costing spreadsheet:
    #
    #   - range of clear-field Uo factors
    #   - range of PSI factors (i.e. MAJOR thermal bridging), e.g. corners
    #
    # Ref: EVOKE BTAP costing spreadsheet modifications (2022), synced with:
    #      - Building Envelope Thermal Bridging Guide (BETBG)
    #      - ASHRAE RP-1365, ISO-12011, etc.
    #
    # This module has been subsequently adapted following the adoption of new
    # BTAP structure/envelope data model/classes.

    # --- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- --- #
    # BTAP costing data (both original BTAP envelope entries and EVOKE add-ons)
    # hold sub-variants based on cladding/veneer, e.g.:
    #
    #   - "BTAP-ExteriorWall-WoodFramed-5" ... brick veneer
    #   - "BTAP-ExteriorWall-WoodFramed-1" ... wood siding
    #
    # Not all of these sub-variants are currently used within BTAP, e.g.
    # "BTAP-ExteriorWall-WoodFramed-1" is unused. BTAP/TBD data is limited
    # to the following wall assemblies (paired LP & HP variants), which
    # eventually should be located in a shared file (e.g. CSV, JSON).
    #
    #   -----   Low Performance (LP) assemblies
    #   ID    : layers
    #   -----   ------------------------------------------
    #   STEL1 : cladding | board   | wool | frame | gypsum
    #   WOOD5 : brick    | board   | wool | frame | gypsum
    #   MASS2 : brick    | xps     |      | cmu   |
    #   MASS4 : precast  | xps     | wool | frame | gypsum
    #
    #   -----   High Performance (HP) variants
    #   ID    : layers
    #   -----   ------------------------------------------
    #   STEL2 : cladding | board   | wool | frame | gypsum ... switch from STEL1
    #   WOOD7 : brick    | mineral | wool | frame | gypsum ... switch from WOOD5
    #   MASSB : brick    | mineral | cmu  | foam  | gypsum ... switch from MASS2
    #   MASS8 : precast  | xps     | wool | frame | gypsum ... switch from MASS4

    # Paired LPs & HPs vall variants are critical for 'uprating' cases, e.g.
    # NECB2017/2020. See below, and end of this document for additional NOTES.

      #   - requested high (HP) vs low-performance (LP) PSI-factor level
      #
      # Ideally, chosen PSI factor sets and matching OpenStudio constructions
      # shouldn't strictly be based on selected BTAP assemblies (e.g.
      # wood-framed vs steel-framed, cladding choice), but also on selected
      # building 'structure', e.g.:
      #
      #   - "wood-framed" MURB
      #   - "steel post/beam" office building
      #   - "reinforced concrete post/beam" public library
      #   - "metal(-building)" warehouse
      #   - "mass-timber (CLT)" university pavilion
      #
      # Major thermal bridges often consist of anchors or supports that transmit
      # structural loads (and by the same token, 'heat') to a building's main
      # structure. Examples include balconies, parapets and shelf angles.
      # Highly conductive building structures (e.g. steel, aluminium) exacerbate
      # thermal bridging effects - so building structural selection matters.
      #
      # The BTAP::Structure module generates such attributes, yet BTAP's costed
      # thermal bridging database doesn't yet distinguish between building
      # structures - @todo. For the moment, BTAP PSI set selection is strictly
      # based on BTAP::Structure's :framing, :cladding and :finish attributes,
      # which must be set prior to initiating BTAP's TBD's thermal bridging
      # solution:

      # Light gauge steel framing by default. Override if wood, cmu or precast.
