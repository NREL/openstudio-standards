      # This method takes a surface in the x-y plane (z coordinates are ignored) with an upwardly pointing normal and
      # turns it into convex quadrialaterals.  If the original surface is already a convex quadrilateral then this method
      # will go to a lot of trouble to return the same thing (only with the coordinates of the points rounded).  If
      # the surface is already a concave surface then this method will return it broken into a bunch of quadrilaters
      # (maybe a triangle here and there). Neither of the above are especially useful.  However, the point of this
      # method is if you pass this a concave surface it will return convex surfaces that you can then use with other
      # methods that only apply to convex surfaces (such as a method which fits skylights into a roof).  Note that
      # surfaces per say are not returned.  Rather, an array containing 4 points arranged in counter clockwise order is
      # returned.  These points are also in the x-y plane with an upwardly pointing normal.  No z coordinate is returned.
      #
      # The method works by first looking for upward pointing lines.  It then looks for cooresponding downward pointing
      # lines.  Since all of the surfaces are closed there should always be enough upward and downward pointing lines.
      # Horizontal lines are ignored.  It then checks to see which y projections of the upward and downward pointing
      # lines overlap.  It then sees which of these overlaping lines overlap.  Ultimately you wind up with a whole bunch
      # of overlapping y projections that coorespond with different upward pointing lines.  These overlapping
      # y projects are either unique, or they precisely match other overlapping y projections.  The point is that, in
      # the case of a convex shape, an upward pointing line may overlap with some lines close, and some far away, with
      # some lines in between.  The method then sorts through the overlapping y projections to see which are closest
      # to a given upward pointing line.  It keeps the unique ones, and the ones that are closest.  The end result
      # should be downward pointing line segments that correspond to an upward pointing line segment with no intervening
      # lines.  The last part of the method assembles the quadrilaterals from the remaining downward pointing line
      # segments which correspond with a given upward pointing line segment.

        # Note that points on surfaces are given counterclockwise when looking at the surface from the opposite direction as
        # the outward normal (i.e. the outward normal is pointing at you).  I use point_a1, point_a2, point_b1 and point b2
        # lots.  For this, point_a refers to vectors pointing up.  In this case point_a1 is at the top of the vector and
        # point_a2 is at the bottom of the vector.  Contrarily, point_b refers to vectors pointing down.  In this case
        # point_b1 is at the bottom of the vector and point_b2 is at the top.  All of this comes about because I cycle
        # through the points starting at the 2nd point and and going to the last point.  I count vectors as starting from
