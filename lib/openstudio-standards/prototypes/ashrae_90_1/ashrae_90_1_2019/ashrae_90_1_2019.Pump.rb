  # Determines the minimum pump motor efficiency and nominal size
  # for a given motor bhp.  This should be the total brake horsepower with
  # any desired safety factor already included.  This method picks
  # the next nominal motor catgory larger than the required brake
  # horsepower, and the efficiency is based on that size.  For example,
  # if the bhp = 6.3, the nominal size will be 7.5HP and the efficiency
  # for 90.1-2010 will be 91.7% from Table 10.8B.  This method assumes
  # 4-pole, 1800rpm totally-enclosed fan-cooled motors.
