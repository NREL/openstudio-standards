  # DEER and MASControl
  # The Database for Energy Efficient Resources (DEER) contains information on selected energy-efficient technologies and measures.
  # The DEER provides estimates of the energy-savings potential for these technologies in residential and nonresidential applications.
  # To determine the energy-savings potential, a DOE-2-based system called MASControl was developed by consultants of
  # the California Public Utility Commission. The DEER "Standards" in this library represent the input assumptions used
  # inside of MASControl to represent CA buildings of different vintages.

  # These EnergyPlus objects implement a proportional control for a single
  # thermal zone with a radiant system. The full details of the control
  # strategy are described in the paper Raftery et al. (2017), "A new control
  # strategy for high thermal mass radiant systems". The work was supported
  # by the California Energy Commission (CEC) Electric Program Investment
