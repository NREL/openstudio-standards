# Features

This library has been developed with three main use-cases in mind:

1. Create the DOE Prototype Buildings in OpenStudio format
2. Create a code baseline model from a proposed model
3. Check a model against a code/standard (not yet implemented)

These three things are all highly related, and share many common subtasks.  For example, since the DOE Prototype Buildings are supposed to be minimally code-compliant buildings, you need to set DX coil efficiencies.  When you are creating a code baseline model, you also need to set DX coil efficiencies.  When you are checking against a code/standard, you need to look up these same DX coil efficiencies. Additionally, all of these methods require access to the information about the minimum efficiencies, u-values, etc. that are defined in the `/data/standards` directory.

The code has been structured such that several higher level methods may all call the same lower level method. For example, both of the methods below eventually call `space_type_add_loads`.  Rather than having two copies of this code inside of the two top level methods, there is one method.

	model_create_prototype_building('Small Office, '90.1-2010', 'ASHRAE 169-2013-5A')
		model_add_schedules
			space_type_add_schedules
		model_apply_standard
			space_type_add_loads(people = true, lights = true, plug_loads = true)
	
	model_create_prm_baseline_building('Small Office', '90.1-2010', 'ASHRAE 169-2013-5A', 'Xcel Energy CO EDA', Dir.pwd, false)
		model_add_baseline_hvac_systems
		model_apply_standard
			space_type_add_loads(people = true, lights = true, plug_loads = false)

Where a method needs to operate **slightly differently** in two different situations, instead of duplicating the code, we make an input argument to tell that method what to do.  In the example above, `space_type_add_loads` is called with `plug_loads = true` when creating the prototype building, but `plug_loads = false` when creating the baseline model, since plug loads stay the same as the proposed model in Appendix G.

Where a method needs to operate **very differently** in two different situations, it should be broken out into a separate method. 

## Outline of the main methods

### `model_create_prototype_model()`**
  - **`load_geometry()`** Loads an `.osm` containing the geomety (including Spaces and SpaceTypes with types assigned) of the model.
  - **`model_add_loads()`** For each `SpaceType` in the model:
    - **`space_type_apply_internal_loads()`** Looks up internal loads from the `OpenStudio_Standards_space_types.json` and sets them
    - **`space_type_apply_internal_load_schedules()`** Looks up internal load schedules from the `OpenStudio_Standards_space_types.json` and sets them
  - **`model_apply_infiltration_standard()`** For each `Space` in the model:
    - **`space_apply_infiltration_rate()`** Sets the infiltration rate for this `Space` based on its exterior surface area.
  - **`model_modify_infiltration_coefficients()`** Sets the terrain and infiltration velocity coefficients.
  - **`model_modify_surface_convection_algorithm()`** Sets the correct simulation settings for surface convection.
  - **`model_add_constructions()`** Creates some generic constructions used by all Prototype models (interior walls, internal mass, etc.).
    - **`model_add_construction_set()`** Looks up the construction set for this building type from `OpenStudio_Standards_construction_sets.json` and adds all constructions in it to the model.
    - **`model_add_construction_set()`** Looks up the construction set for each `SpaceType` from `OpenStudio_Standards_construction_sets.json` and adds all constructions in it to the model.  `SpaceTypes` only have construction sets where they differ from the overall building construction set.
  - **`model_create_thermal_zones()`** Creates one `ThermalZone` with a `ThermostatSetpointDualSetpoint` for each `Space` in the model.  Also sets zone multipliers if defined in `/prototypes/Prototype.large_office.rb`. 
  - **`model_add_hvac()`**
    - **`model_define_hvac_system_map()`** Get a map of HVAC system types from `/prototypes/Prototype.large_office.rb`
    - For each system type listed in the map, create the system using methods like `model_add_cw_loop()` and `model_add_psz_ac()`.  **Note that these methods only create the basic system layout; component efficiencies and code-mandated controls are applied later. Some of the inputs, like which type of heating or cooling fuel to use for these methods are pulled from `OpenStudio_Standards_prototype_inputs.json`.**
  - **`model_custom_hvac_tweaks()`** Some building types have unique HVAC system characteristics.  Rather than putting lots of special conditions for each building type into methods like `model_add_psz_ac`, the changes are defined in isolation for each building type and are made after adding the systems.
  - **`model_add_swh()`** For each service water type (main, booster, laundry) listed in `OpenStudio_Standards_prototype_inputs.json`.  **NOTE: this method is complex because of the inconsistencies in the way water use equipment is specified between different building types.  There is opportunity here to streamline the approach**
    - **`model_add_swh_loop()`** Adds a hot water loop
    - **`model_add_swh_end_uses()`** Adds `WaterUseEquipment` as specified in `OpenStudio_Standards_prototype_inputs.json`.

  - **`model_add_occupancy_sensors()`** Adds lighting power reductions on a space-by-space basis based on `SpaceType`.  **NOTE: This method requires pre-computed assumptions about how much of each `SpaceType` exists in some models.  It would be better to make this more generic.**
  - **`model_add_design_days_and_weather_file()`** Adds design days and weather file for the specified climate zone.
  - **`model_apply_sizing_parameters()`** Sets the heating and cooling sizing factors.  **NOTE: These are not consistent between building types.  Why?**
