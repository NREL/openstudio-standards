# OpenStudio-Standards

openstudio-standards is a Ruby Gem library that extends the {https://www.openstudio.net/ OpenStudio SDK}.
It has four main use-cases:

1. Provide higher level methods to help BEM users and developers to create OpenStudio models from existing geometry, or programmatically generated geometry
2. Create typical building models in OpenStudio format
3. Create a code baseline model from a proposed model
4. Check a model against a code/standard

openstudio-standards previously supported making the DOE/PNNL prototype buildings in OpenStudio format. This has since been deprecated, as the DOE/PNNL prototypes are intended for specific code comparisons under the Energy Policy Act and are not intended to accurately represent typical existing or new buildings. While openstudio-standards still creates typical buildings, these are not the same as the DOE/PNNL prototypes.
